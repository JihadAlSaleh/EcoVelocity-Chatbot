### Fall 2025  

This repository contains the official chatbot created by **Team Eco Velocity** for the **Sand Dune Dash: Payload Challenge**.  
The chatbot is designed to answer questions about our project, our vehicle’s design, materials, constraints, and engineering decisions.

## 📦 Project Overview
The Sand Dune Dash requires designing and building a sustainable, gravity-powered vehicle capable of transporting a **6.5 × 6.5 × 6.5 cm water-filled acrylic cube** down a **1.3 m, 30° ramp** with minimal water loss and maximum speed.

Our team designed a **wooden vehicle with a gyroscope-based payload stabilizer**, a spring suspension system, foam protection, and metal-rod axles. The chatbot provides information about the design, constraints, materials, testing, and performance.

## 🤖 Chatbot Purpose
NGN110 requires each team to develop a chatbot that:
- Understands the project  
- Can answer the instructor’s questions  
- Demonstrates knowledge of constraints, design decisions, and performance  
- Correctly answers at least **2 out of 3** questions  

This chatbot uses a simple Python script with a custom knowledge base (`project_knowledge.txt`) to generate keyword-based answers.
